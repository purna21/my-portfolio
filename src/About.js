                Iam a 24 year old Computer Science Graduate, aspiring to become a Front - End Web Developer.
                Despite of graduating in 2019, I have given myself some time to explore and try different things and
                see what interests and motivates me in the long run. And in meantime, I have figured out that Web Development
                is the thing for me and started to learn web technologies in the recent past.
